            PERSONAL DATA
            <p>
              Mesensei is driven by Privacy by Design and compliance with EU
              General Data Protection Regulation. Mesensei is committed to the
              principles of data minimisation and Data Subject Rights. Therefore
              the use of the Mesensei mobile app does not require personally
              identifiable contact information.

          <li>
            PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION
            <p>
              When you install the application and start using it, you are asked
              to enter a nickname. If you wish to remain anonymous do not use a
              nickname, which can be associated to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              The application contacts servers used by Mesensei and your device
              is assigned an unique user id, which connects your device to your
              user account.The identifier is locked to the device you use and
              cannot be transferred to another device. Therefore, the
              application and the content you have generated cannot be
              transferred to another device. If you install the application to
              another device your nickname, message history, and stored
              favourites will not be transferred and Mesensei administration
              cannot restore them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond the device identifier, Mesensei does not collect personal,
              or any other data, with the intention to identify to unique users
              personally.
            </p>
            <p>
              Message and voice communication is protected by data encryption.
              The voice calls are not recorded or stored by Mesensei. Chat
              history remains accessible on both your and your mentorâ€™s device
              and on the servers needed for the message content relay.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please keep in mind that the mentors are acting on their own
              behalf. Mesensei does not monitor any communication between you
              and the mentors and is not responsible for the relationship you
              establish in the application, or during the event. Do not provide
              any confidential information information if you do not trust the
              other party.
